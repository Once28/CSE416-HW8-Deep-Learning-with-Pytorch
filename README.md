# CSE416-HW8-Deep-Learning-with-Pytorch

In this deep learning project, I utilized PyTorch and Neural Networks to develop a model capable of accurately recognizing colored 32x32 images. The goal was to achieve a high level of accuracy in image classification, and after extensive training, the model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%.  To accomplish this, I utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image recognition tasks. The model was trained on a large dataset of colored images, using both a training and validation set to optimize performance.  During the training process, I experimented with different hyperparameters and techniques to improve accuracy, including data augmentation, regularization, and varying the number of layers and neurons in the network. Additionally, I fine-tuned the model by adjusting the learning rate and using early stopping to prevent overfitting.  The resulting model achieved a 97% accuracy rate on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately classifying colored images. This project showcases my skills in deep learning, data processing, and model optimization, and serves as a testament to my ability to develop sophisticated machine learning solutions to complex problems.
